    <h1>Welcome to this online Drum-pad!</h1>
    <p> 
        A drum pad is a digital instrument made up of touch- or click-sensitive pads that play different sounds when
        pressed. Each pad is usually assigned to a specific drum sound, such as a kick, snare, hi-hat, or percussion
        effect.

        Drum pads are commonly used in music production, beat making, and live performances. They allow musicians and
        producers to create rhythms by tapping the pads with their fingers, a mouse, or a keyboard, making the
        experience feel more hands-on and expressive than using traditional buttons or menus.

        In a web-based drum pad, each pad reacts instantly to user input and plays a sound using audio files. This makes
        it possible to create beats directly in a browser without installing any software. Drum pads are popular because
        they are simple to use, fun to interact with, and great for learning rhythm and timing.

        Whether you are a beginner experimenting with beats or a producer sketching ideas quickly, a drum pad is a
        powerful and creative tool.
